# CLIP-based-NSFW-Detector

This 2 class NSFW-detector is a lightweight Autokeras model that takes CLIP ViT L/14 embbedings as inputs.
It estimates a value between 0 and 1 (1 = NSFW) and works well with embbedings from images.


The training CLIP V L/14 embbedings can be downloaded here:

The (manually annotated) test set is there https://github.com/LAION-AI/CLIP-based-NSFW-Detector/blob/main/nsfw_testset.zip
